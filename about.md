Head of Software at [Nourish Care](http://nourishcare.co.uk).

Pet-project programmer on most nights, rainy Saturdays and Sundays.

Paragliding pilot the rest of the time.

### Background

Started programming at the age of 10 because I wanted to be an hacker.

Had some fun with C and C++, currently working with Ruby, excited about elixir.
