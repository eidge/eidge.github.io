So... yeah... yup, anh han...

It's basically been like the 1000th time I tried to start writing regularly, but somehow it never really takes off.

I usually start with big plans and ideas which inevitably end up in procastrinating over the idea of perfect. This time, I'm starting **stupid simple** and **raw** - one post a week (even if it's only a paragraph) about whatever comes to my mind. No expectations, no defined subjects, no goals except **writing more**.

There! It's public, now it's gotta happen.

Cya next week :)
